## üßæ Summary of Findings

During the packet capture session, several key protocols were identified and analyzed. These protocols are fundamental to everyday internet communication and provide insight into how data travels across networks.

### üîç Protocols Observed

| Protocol | Function | Key Observations |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **HTTP** | Web traffic (GET/POST requests) | Captured requests to websites like `example.com`, showing headers and response codes |
| **DNS** | Resolves domain names to IP addresses | Queries to resolve domains such as `google.com`, with responses containing IP addresses |
| **TCP** | Reliable data transmission | Included 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and data segments between client and server |
| **UDP** | Lightweight, connectionless transport | Used in DNS queries; faster but less reliable than TCP |
| **ICMP** | Diagnostic messages (e.g., ping) | Echo requests and replies used to test connectivity to external servers |
